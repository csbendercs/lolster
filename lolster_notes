- finish implementation of Match models fields
    - ordering based on date created
- finish implementation of getMatchDetail, grab data from riot api and store in DB
    - epoch time (date created)
    - win/loss from each player
    - game version
    - itemList implementation
    -

- implement various statistics from data in DB
    - different champions list total
    - champion vs champion match up (different lanes as well?) based on champions list total
        - core build (up to item3)
    - champion vs team match up
        - (item 4- 6)



- should i implement scripts into views? --> list_route()  / detail_route()
- possibly use dataframes to store and manage data?

Available Data:
itemlist --> item 1 - 6
win rate per summoner  --> 10 times
lane per summoner --> 10 times

===================

Goals:

champ vs champ (1v1 lane) [conditional probaiblity]

champion counter pick - champ vs team (1v1 team) [conditional probability]
    champ A vs each individual on opposing team - 5 statics (add to champion counter suggestion)

high item pick rate [marginal probability]

===================

markov chain model
Probability of winning champ A vs champ B

Probability of winning champA + item 1-6 vs champ B

item slot 1
P(win) * P(item1|win)

item slot 2
p(win) * P(item1|win) * P(item2|item1)
